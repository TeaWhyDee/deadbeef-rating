# DeaDBeeF Song Rating plugin

A plugin enabling commands to rate track(s) by writing to the `%rating%` metadata tag. The commands are accessible from the context menu or by binding them to hotkeys. 

Big thanks to [Alexey Yakovenko](https://github.com/Alexey-Yakovenko) for the [DeaDBeeF](http://deadbeef.sourceforge.net/) music player.

# Building & Installing
1. Clone this repository
2. Download `deadbeef.h`, for example from the [DeaDBeeF source code](http://deadbeef.sourceforge.net/download.html).
3. Run `sh build.sh [path to dir with deadbeef.h]`
4. Run `sh easyinstall.sh` to install the plugin to ~/.local/lib/deadbeef, or copy `rating.so` yourself to your DeaDBeeF plugin folder.

# Uninstalling
Run `sh easyuninstall.sh` to remove the plugin from ~/.local/lib/deadbeef, or remove `rating.so` yourself from your DeaDBeeF plugin folder.

# Using
In order to show the rating tags in the playlist, add a new custom column with the following format:

`$ifequal([%rating%], 5, *****,)$ifequal([%rating%], 4, ****,)$ifequal([%rating%], 3, ***,)$ifequal([%rating%], 2, **,)$ifequal([%rating%], 1, *,)`

If you want, you can replace `*` with your rating indicator of choice. For example with beautiful awesome stars:

`$ifequal([%rating%], 5,★★★★★,)$ifequal([%rating%], 4,★★★★,)$ifequal([%rating%], 3,★★★,)$ifequal([%rating%], 2,★★,)$ifequal([%rating%], 1,★,)`

Or combine them with empty stars:

`$ifequal([%rating%], 5,★★★★★,)$ifequal([%rating%], 4,★★★★☆,)$ifequal([%rating%], 3,★★★☆☆,)$ifequal([%rating%], 2,★★☆☆☆,)$ifequal([%rating%], 1,★☆☆☆☆,)$ifequal([%rating%], 0,☆☆☆☆☆,)`
